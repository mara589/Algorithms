# Tree Search

First, you need the number of nodes in the tree for these searches.

Each tree is represented with an array:
- the position of each element in the array represents a node
- an element in the array represents the parent of the node at that position
- the root is the parent of a node is equal to the node (i.e. the value at position i is equal to i)
- the values in the array can only be between 0..(n - 1), where n is the number of nodes in the tree
